      35:  Sum of its digits is  8,   which is NOT prime.
      36:  Sum of its digits is  9,   which is NOT prime.
      37:  Sum of its digits is 10,   which is NOT prime.
      38:  Sum of its digits is 11,   which IS prime.     Got one.
      39:  Sum of its digits is 12,   which is NOT prime.
      40:  Sum of its digits is  4,   which is NOT prime.
      41:  Sum of its digits is  5,   which IS prime.     Got second.
      42:  Sum of its digits is  6,   which is NOT prime.
      43:  Sum of its digits is  7,   which IS prime.     Got third.
      44:  Sum of its digits is  8,   which is NOT prime.
      45:  Sum of its digits is  9,   which is NOT prime.
      46:  Sum of its digits is 10,   which is NOT prime.
      47:  Sum of its digits is 11,   which IS prime.     Got fourth.

    At that point, the function should return [38, 41, 43, 47].

    Another example: suppose that m is 119 and n is 3. Then this
    function examines the following integers, in the order listed:

      120:  Sum of its digits is  3,   which IS prime.
      121:  Sum of its digits is  4,   which is NOT prime.
      122:  Sum of its digits is  5,   which IS prime.
