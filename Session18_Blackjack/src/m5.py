"""
Stage 5: REFACTOR Stage 4 to eliminate the DUPLICATION
         in the Dealer and HumanPlayer classes, as follows:

  -- There is now a  Player  class.

  -- Both the  Dealer  and  HumanPlayer  classes extend
       (aka inherit from) the Player class.

  -- The  Hand  data attribute that was in both the Dealer
       and HumanPlayer classes is now in the  Player  class.

  -- Likewise, the  take_card(Card)  method that was in both the Dealer
       and HumanPlayer classes is now in the  Player  class.

  -- The constructor (__init__) methods for the Dealer and
       HumanPlayer call the constructor method for the Player class.

You can test the above by running the program.
It should print the same as it did in the previous stage.
