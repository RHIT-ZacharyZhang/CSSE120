Stage 2: In addition to Stage 1, adds a Deck of Cards, as follows:

  -- The  play_hand()  method displays all the Cards in the Deck
       by using the Deck's  show_cards()  method.

  -- The Deck class now has:
       -- a  show_cards()  method that shows all the Cards
            currently in the Deck, in their current order.
       -- a data attribute (aka instance variable) that is a list that
            initially contains the 52 Cards in a standard deck of cards.

  -- There is a  Card  class that has:
       -- data attributes (aka instance variables) for the Card's:
            -- suit_number (1, 2, 3, or 4, for Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club)
            -- pip (1, 2, 3, ... 13, where 1 is Ace, ... 13 is King)
       -- a  __repr__()   method that prints the Card in a reasonable way.

You can test the above by running the program.
Implementing the above should cause the program to display on the console:
  Playing a hand:
  Spade A
  Spade 2
  Spade 3
    ...
  Club Q
  Club K
