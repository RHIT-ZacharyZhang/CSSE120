As always, do the Preparation for this session before doing this project.

As the Preparation says, you are to implement the first 6 stages
of a Blackjack program by CODING AS YOU WATCH THE RELEVANT VIDEO.
That is:
  1. Open m1. As you watch the video for Stage 1, put your own code into m1.
  2. Open m2. As you watch the video for Stage 2, put your own code into m2.
    ... (etc for m3, m4, m5)
  6. Open m6. As you watch the video for Stage 6, put your own code into m6.
  

At any point, you are also welcome to look at the ANSWER file for that stage.
Do whatever is best for your own learning.

Once you finish m6, you can use it as your starting point for
implementing a Human player and the Dealer, or you can use m7_blackjack.
The latter is the same as the end of the video for Stage 7.
