"""
Stage 1: Begins the game, as follows:

  -- main:
       -- constructs a Blackjack object and
       -- asks the Blackjack object to play a hand.

  -- There is a  Blackjack   class that has:
       -- a  play_hand()   method that (at this stage)
            simply prints "Playing a hand:"
       -- 3 data attributes (aka instance variables) that are a:
            -- Deck
            -- Dealer
            -- HumanPlayer
          where Deck, Dealer and HumanPlayer are each a class
          that (in this stage) does nothing.

You can test the above by running the program.
Implementing the above should cause the program to display on the console:
  Playing a hand:
