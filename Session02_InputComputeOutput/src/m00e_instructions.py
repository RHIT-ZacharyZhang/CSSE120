# Students:  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS
#            from your instructor (David Mutchler).
#
# To do the "in-class" Session 2:
#
#   0. If you have not already done so, email me your completed
#         quiz from the Session 2 Preparation.
#
#   1. When you check out this project and begin working on it,
#         email me a brief note saying "I am starting Session 2."
#
#   2. At the same time, if you have Lync or Skype on your computer,
#      try to open a chat window with me:
#        -- The Rose-Hulman laptops come with Lync installed.
#           Just type   Lync   in the Start Menu.
#        -- In the   Lync  window, select the icon that looks like
#           a person to make a new Contact that is me
#           (just search for   David Mutchler).
#        -- Once you have me as a Contact, select the icon for Chat.
#      If you cannot get Lync to work or don't have it, no worries.
#
#   3. Work through the files in order: m0, m1, ...

#        -- For example files (m0e, m1e, m5e, ...), read/skim each
#           (spend as much or as little time on each as you wish)
#           and RUN each.
#
#        -- For the non-example files, do the TODO items in them.
#
#      Do SVN ~ Commit to commit your work (i.e., to turn it in).
#      Do FREQUENT commits -- each saves your work "in the cloud"
#      and you can commit a file as often as you wish.
#
#      If you have questions during the session, communicate
#      with me in any of the following ways (your choice):
#        a. Post a question on Piazza.
#             [I get real-time notices of each post.]
#        b. Chat with me in Lync/Skype.
#        c. Call me on my cell (812) 878-4205.
#        d. Email me.
#
#      In future sessions we will try out the  Saros  tool,
#      but let's keep it simple for starters.
#
# After you have read these instructions, do them.
# There is nothing to turn in from this file.
